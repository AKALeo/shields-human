# shields-human
adding netease music and bilibili support for shields (the README badge generation service)

# How to use

1. Install Shields. <https://github.com/badges/shields>
1. Somehow install this nodejs peoject: <https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi>
2. Replace `server.js` of the stock Shields project with mine.
2. Find the string "netease" in my version of server.js and modify it (as you may have the netease api program running on other servers or ports)
2. Start these two programs with your favourite nodejs process manager.
3. No need to refer to `try.html`.

Detailed documentation coming soon
